Hi, I'm JD Tamucci — a Ph.D. scientist, M.P.H., and science communicator based in Rhode Island. Since earning my Ph.D. in Molecular & Cell Biology and my M.P.H. from the University of Connecticut in May 2024, I’ve been continuing to build bridges between data, discovery, and the public good.

### 👨‍🔬 Current Work

After graduation, I transitioned into a part-time Research Scientist role at UConn to finalize and submit follow-up work from my dissertation. I remain actively involved in the final analyses and manuscript revisions for that project, which explores how synthetic peptides interact with mitochondrial membranes under stress.

In parallel, I’ve begun collaborating with the **Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH)** to support their disaster response and surveillance work:
- Conducted a literature review on surveillance strategies across various disaster types (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and natural).
- Developed a reference guide for disaster-specific surveillance tools.
- Contributing to the design of screening tools for long-term health monitoring of disaster-affected populations.

### 🕵️‍♂️ Excited for EIS

In October 2024, I was thrilled to be accepted into the **CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS)** — a program I’ve aspired to join since the early days of my Ph.D. EIS represents a perfect convergence of my scientific training, communication experience, and commitment to service. I’m currently preparing for the next stage of that journey.

### 🔬 Scientific Focus

My doctoral work used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a novel class of mitochondria-targeted peptide therapeutics for age-related and neurodegenerative diseases. I developed custom simulation parameters for synthetic peptides and lipids, scaled simulations with HPC, and co-authored four papers (two as first author).

### 🖥️ HPC & Technical Skills

As an HPC system administrator at UConn, I supported 2,000+ users across diverse disciplines, created training documentation, and integrated computing into multiple courses — growing usage by 50%. I’m comfortable managing complex software environments, coding in Python and Bash, and automating analysis pipelines.

### 🗣️ Communication

I've written 20+ science videos for YouTube shows like SciShow and the American Public Health Association’s **That's Public Health** series, with a focus on clarity and accuracy for general audiences.
