While I don't plan to pursue teaching as a primary career path, it has shaped who I am as a scientist and communicator. For many years, the environment I worked in was a classroom ‚Äî and I‚Äôve always believed in solving the problems in front of me. In teaching, that meant improving how we support students, structure material, and explain complex concepts.

Teaching taught me how to guide, translate, and adapt ‚Äî qualities that now serve me in research, policy, and public health. Even outside the classroom, I carry those lessons with me.
